## Prerequisites
Before proceeding with the migration, ensure the following:
- **tfvenv Installed**: Ensure that tfvenv is installed and properly configured on your system. Refer to the tfvenv Installation Guide if needed.
- **Backup Mechanism**: Familiarity with backing up Terraform state files and configurations.
- **Access Permissions**: Appropriate permissions to create and manage environments and access necessary directories.

## Overview of Migration Process
Migrating Terraform versions involves the following key steps:
1. **Backup**: Safeguard your current configurations and state files.
2. **Version Selection**: Identify the target Terraform version.
3. **Environment Setup**: Create a new tfvenv environment with the desired Terraform version.
4. **Activation**: Switch to the new environment.
5. **Initialization and Validation**: Initialize Terraform and validate configurations.
6. **Application**: Apply any necessary changes.
7. **Deactivation and Cleanup**: Revert to the old environment if needed and clean up unused resources.

## Step-by-Step Migration Guide

### 1. Backup Your Current Environment
**Why**:  
Before making any changes, it's crucial to back up your existing Terraform configurations and state files to prevent data loss in case of unexpected issues.

**Steps**:
- Navigate to Your Terraform Project Directory:
    ```bash
    cd /path/to/your/terraform/project
    ```
- Backup State Files:
    - If using local state files:
      ```bash
      cp terraform.tfstate terraform.tfstate.backup
      cp terraform.tfstate.backup terraform.tfstate.backup.json
      ```
    - If using remote state (e.g., S3), ensure remote backups are enabled or manually back up as per your backend's capabilities.
- Backup Configuration Files:
    ```bash
    cp -r .tfvars .tfvars.backup
    cp -r terragrunt.hcl terragrunt.hcl.backup
    ```
- Optional - Export Current Environment Variables:
    ```bash
    export > env_backup.sh
    ```

### 2. List Available Terraform Versions
**Why**:  
Understanding available Terraform versions helps in selecting a compatible and stable version for your projects.

**Steps**:
- Use tfvenv to List Available Versions:
    ```bash
    tfvenv list-versions
    ```
- Sample Output:
    ```markdown
    Fetching the last 5 versions for Terraform and Terragrunt...

    Terraform Versions:
    - 1.1.0
    - 1.0.7
    - 1.0.6
    - 1.0.5
    - 1.0.4

    Terragrunt Versions:
    - 0.36.0
    - 0.35.0
    - 0.34.0
    - 0.33.0
    - 0.32.0
    ```
- Choose the Target Terraform Version:  
  Review the listed versions and select the desired one (e.g., 1.1.0).

### 3. Create a New Environment with the Target Terraform Version
**Why**:  
Creating a separate environment ensures that the migration does not interfere with your current setup, allowing for testing before fully committing to the new version.

**Steps**:
- Run the Create Command:
    ```bash
    tfvenv create <new-env-name> <target-tf-version> <current-tg-version>
    ```
    - `<new-env-name>`: A distinct name for the new environment (e.g., dev_v1.1).
    - `<target-tf-version>`: The Terraform version you intend to migrate to (e.g., 1.1.0).
    - `<current-tg-version>`: The current Terragrunt version or specify none if not using Terragrunt.

Example:
```bash
tfvenv create dev_v1.1 1.1.0 0.35.0
```

### 4. Activate the New Environment
**Why**:  
Activating the new environment configures your shell to use the specified Terraform version and associated settings, ensuring that subsequent commands operate within the correct context.

**Steps**:
- Run the Activate Command:
    ```bash
    tfvenv activate <new-env-name>
    ```
- Source the Activation Script:
    ```bash
    source /path/to/env/bin/activate.sh
    ```
- Verify the Active Terraform Version:
    ```bash
    terraform --version
    ```

### 5. Initialize Terraform
**Why**:  
Initializing Terraform ensures that all necessary plugins are downloaded and the working directory is prepared for deployment.

**Steps**:
- Navigate to Your Terraform Project Directory:
    ```bash
    cd /path/to/your/terraform/project
    ```
- Run Terraform Init:
    ```bash
    terraform init
    ```

### 6. Validate the Configuration
**Why**:  
Validating your Terraform configuration checks for syntax errors and compatibility issues with the new version, preventing potential deployment failures.

**Steps**:
- Run Terraform Validate:
    ```bash
    terraform validate
    ```

### 7. Apply Changes
**Why**:  
Applying the changes ensures that your infrastructure is updated according to the configurations using the new Terraform version.

**Steps**:
- Run Terraform Plan:
    ```bash
    terraform plan
    ```
- Run Terraform Apply:
    ```bash
    terraform apply
    ```

### 8. Deactivate the Old Environment
**Why**:  
After successfully migrating and verifying the new environment, deactivating the old environment prevents accidental use and frees up resources.

**Steps**:
- Run the Deactivate Command:
    ```bash
    tfvenv deactivate <old-env-name>
    ```
- Source the Deactivation Script:
    ```bash
    source /path/to/old-env/bin/deactivate.sh
    ```

### 9. Cleanup (Optional)
**Why**:  
Removing the old environment helps in maintaining a clean workspace and conserving system resources.

**Steps**:
- Delete the Old Environment:
    ```bash
    tfvenv delete --env <old-env-name>
    ```

## Handling Potential Issues

### 1. Plugin Compatibility
**Issue**:  
Providers or modules used in your configurations are incompatible with the new Terraform version.

**Solution**:
- Update Providers:
    ```bash
    terraform providers lock
    terraform init -upgrade
    ```

### 2. State File Conflicts
**Issue**:  
State files may have discrepancies after upgrading Terraform versions.

**Solution**:
- Always backup your state files before making changes.
- Use `terraform state` commands to manage and migrate state files if necessary.

### 3. Environment Activation Failures
**Issue**:  
Activation scripts fail to set environment variables correctly.

**Solution**:
- Check Activation Scripts.
- Review Logs for detailed error messages.

### 4. Unexpected Resource Changes
**Issue**:  
Applying changes leads to unintended modifications in your infrastructure.

**Solution**:
- Thoroughly review the output of `terraform plan` before applying.
- Manage your Terraform configurations using version control systems like Git to track changes.
